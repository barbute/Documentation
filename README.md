# Prosper Robotics

The [Prosper Engineering Team](https://www.prosperengineeringteam.com/) Robotics Division is a collection of three [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) teams that work in coordination to compete at the annual FIRST Robotics Competition. This documentation details the Programming Team's standards in regards to code naming, formatting, project organization, and best programming practices.

Some articles have also been specifically dedicated to documenting knowledge gained throughout the years that is not explicitly stated on the official [WPI Lib Docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html).

Here is an index of this documentation:

- 🌳 [GitHub Standards](/Documentation/GithubDocs/GITHUB_DOCS.md)
- 🧑‍💻 Programming Conventions
- 📈 Advantage Suite Documentation

Currently the team uses GitHub and Visual Studio Code. As such, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the technologies before reading further in-depth.
