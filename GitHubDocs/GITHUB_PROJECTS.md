# ðŸ“½ Projects

An excellent way to organize a long-term code project is to use GitHub Projects. GitHub Projects allow teams to visualize due dates, see specific tasks in every category, add issues to specific GitHub repositories and add it as a task, and so much more. Projects are very powerful and easy to setup systems, that can keep small teams in check. The utility is heavily integrated with GitHub, and as such has a lot of convienence features when working with it.

This article is to walk-through a standard Projects setup.

Click the green "New Project" button.

Give the project an appropriate name and start with the `Robot Template`. This template sets up most of the options for you, however you will need to edit some values.

Click the green "Create" button.

You will see a view that looks something like this:

> NOTE: The input fields may be a bit larger on your screen since GitHub does not automatically scale them to fit the screen

Here is a brief description of each field:

- **Title**: A one-line description of what needs to be done

- **Repository**: The repository this task needs to be assigned to

  - If there are none, do not select a repository

- **Assignees**: Who needs to work on the project

  - This field sometimes glitches, you may need to click a person multiple times to add them

- **Status**: Update status based on where you are with a task
- **Start**: The day task is started, the task starts the minute the clock strikes 12
- **Due**: The day the task is meant to end. Note that the task should be largely completed before this day even arrives
-  **Phase**: Groups tasks into stages. Each stage needs to be completed before moving on to the next one
- **Subsystem**: Specifies the subsystem that needs to be worked on
